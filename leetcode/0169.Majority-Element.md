# Majority Element

https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/

tag: `easy`

## Description

Given an array of size *n*, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears **more than** `⌊ n/2 ⌋` times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

## Solution

### Approach 1: Brute Force

#### Intuition

We can exhaust the search space in quadratic time by checking whether each element is the majority element.

#### Algorithm

The brute force algorithm iterates over the array, and then iterates again for each number to count its occurrences. As soon as a number is fount to have appeared more than any other can possibly have appeared, return it.

**Java solution**

```java
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int majorityCount = nums.length/2;

        for (int num : nums) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int elem : nums) {
                if (elem == num) {
                    count += 1;
                }
            }

            if (count > majorityCount) {
                return num;
            }

        }

        return -1;    
    }
}
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: *O(n^2)*

  The brute force algorithm contains two nested `for` loops that each run for *n* iterations, adding up to quadratic time complexity.

- Spacy complexity: *O(1)*

  The brute force solution does not allocate additional space proportional to th
