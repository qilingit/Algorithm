# Description

https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

**Examples:**

```
s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode"
return 2.
```

 

**Note:** You may assume the string contains only lowercase English letters.

# Give skeleton solution

```java
class solution {
	public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
	
	}
}
```

# Idea

Build an array with length of 26, make the value of each element (index 0 to 25) equals to existence of character **a** to **z**, 



# Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
        int[] table = new int[26];
        
        for(char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            table[c-97]++;
        }
        
        for(char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if(table[c-97] == 1) {
                return s.indexOf(c);
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```
